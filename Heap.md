```
* pointer 
** double-pointer 
& address of variable

access the value of num
num == *pr2 == **pr1 

value of pr2 = addr of num (&num) 

with *pr2 we access the value of the addr stored in pr2 which is the addr of num (&num).


value of pr1 = addr of pr2 (&pr2)

with ** we treat the value stored in p2 (the addr of num) (&num) as a pointer so we get the value of    *(&num) which is simply the value of num.


addr of num
&num == pr2 == *pr1 

addr of pr2
&pr2 == pr1 (Bearbeitet)
